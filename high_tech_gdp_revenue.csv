Definition:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gross Domestic Product is the total value of an industry's output, minus the value of any intermediate inputs purchased from other industries (domestic or foreign). It is measured at basic prices, meaning it includes taxes on production and excludes any subsidy on production. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Constant dollars mean that the price in each observation year has been adjusted (chained) to reflect that of the base year (in this case, 2012). This adjustment eliminates the changes in purchasing power over time. Period to period changes in the series reflect only changes in produced quantity, not prices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
